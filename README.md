# yoshi-scratch
A 2D game created from "Scratch"

This game was developed as part of my learning journey through the "Harvard CS50x" online course. Utilizing Scratch as the beginner development platform, this project served as my introduction to the fundamentals of programming, including algorithms, control structures, user interface design, event-driven programming, problem-solving, debugging, creative coding, and other essential concepts. The inspiration behind this game is my love for Yoshi, a character in the Nintendo franchise.

You may run the game via this URL: [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670243690](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670243690/embed)
and view the HTML file 'yoshi-fruit-sploot.html' (converted via packager.turbowarp.org)
You may also run the game by downloading the HTML file and opening it on a web browser.

Please click the spacebar and the green flag to start the gameplay. The instructions will show after Yoshi's starting screen. To reset the game, it is best to refresh the page to avoid any reload errors. Thank you!
