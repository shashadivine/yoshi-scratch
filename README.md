# yoshi-scratch
A 2D game created from "Scratch"

This game was developed as part of my learning journey through the "Harvard CS50x" online course. Utilizing Scratch as the beginner development platform, this project served as my introduction to the fundamentals of programming, including algorithms and other essential concepts. The inspiration behind this game is my love for Yoshi, a character in the Nintendo franchise.
